The owned worker receives a single-thread hint and configured per-process ceilings of at most 1 GiB virtual address space and 120 CPU seconds, each clamped so inherited soft or hard limits are never raised, plus a 120-second shared launch deadline, 64 MiB input/output bounds and 8 MiB diagnostic/report stream bounds. This adapter does not impose an aggregate process-count or cgroup memory limit.",
