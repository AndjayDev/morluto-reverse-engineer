The raw output is authoritative and REA does not claim a stable normalized format. DWARF does not follow local debug links by default. Set follow_debug_links to true to follow them; identities of external debug files are not bound to Evidence. REA clears DEBUGINFOD_URLS for objdump so DWARF processing does not make debuginfod network requests. Architecture output is subjectless and does not establish support for any artifact.",
